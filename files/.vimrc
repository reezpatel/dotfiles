map gt <C-]>
map gb <C-T>

"   Vim and other tools inside an xterm think Delete key is <backspace>
"   and Backspace key is <delete> but we cannot just swap them. In
"   Vim this swapping doesn't work and via xmodmap other X11 applications
"   would be affected, too. So we the following: We map Delete to CTRL-D
"   for the XTerms via xrdb and then remap the keys here in Vim.
